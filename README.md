A data layer that leverages the Entity Factory Design Pattern to provide high performance for Low Code Development Platforms.

I'll post some documentation on programming with this data layer, shortly.

This data layer currently supports SQL Server and .NET.

Please, look for the Entity Factory Desing Pattern in the Code Project website to understand the underlying pattern used by this data layer.
